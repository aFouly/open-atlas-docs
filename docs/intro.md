# Overview

Open Atlas Vantage is the EUDR analysis tool, designed to assess the compliance status of source-commodity production locations with respect to the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).

# **Interface**

Vantage provides the API to cover the entire flow of deforestation and location-specific legislation risk assessment. The API allows you to:

- Register the plot of land. This includes both polygon and point geolocation.
- Run risk assessment for selected plots of land.
- Retrieve risk assessment results in the form of calculated values and visual representation.

The API allows running analysis globally and at scale.

# **Tokens**

Once you have your account set up, you have a dedicated number of tokens to perform risk assessment. At OpenAtlas, we aim to provide transparent pricing to ensure a straightforward integration. Therefore, for each registered plot, we explicitly provide the number of tokens that will take to run the risk assessment.

You can always access information about the currently available and reserved tokens.

# **Documentation Overview**

The Vantage documentation provides articles with detailed information about registering the geolocation of plots of land, risk assessment and the end-to-end tutorial on how to run EUDR risk assessment at scale using Vantage API. Additionally, there is an API reference documentation with all the details about every endpoint.
